                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                        <p>My programming journey began with a fascination for technology and a desire to create
                            something from scratch. It started with Q-basic in school, I never liked the debugging
                            of unknown errors so venture into logics with no code, where I taught myself the basics
                            of logic programming language. As I progressed,
                            I see the need to embrace coding in frontend development. With each obstacle overcome
                            and every line of code written, my passion for programming grew, driving me to continue
                            learning and exploring the endless possibilities of the digital world.</p></div>

                        <p>My journey in electrical installation began with a spark of curiosity and a desire to practice my profession.
                            From assisting experienced electricians to completing formal training,I honed my skills in wiring, circuitry,
                             and electrical systems. With each project, I built confidence in my ability,ensuring safety and efficiency.</p>
